## Features and Functionalities

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Secure login/logout functionality.
   - Role-based access control for users.

2. **Data Management**
   - CRUD operations for managing resources.
   - Structured data storage using relational/non-relational databases.

3. **API Development**
   - RESTful API endpoints for external integration.
   - Adherence to best practices for consistent and secure API design.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implementation of caching to improve response times.
   - Asynchronous task processing for heavy computations.

5. **Security**
   - Data encryption (HTTPS/TLS) and input sanitization.
   - Protection against SQL injection and XSS attacks.

6. **Scalability**
   - Modular design to support horizontal and vertical scaling.
   - Integration of microservices for better fault isolation.

## User Stories

1. **As a user,** I want to securely log into the system so that I can access protected resources.
2. **As an admin,** I want to manage user roles so that I can control system access.
3. **As a developer,** I want well-documented API endpoints so that I can easily integrate the backend with the frontend.
4. **As a customer,** I want a fast and reliable system so that my experience is seamless.

## Backend Requirement Specifications

### General Requirements
- The backend should handle at least 1000 concurrent requests.
- The system must follow modular and scalable architecture principles.

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
   - Enable login with email and password.
   - Implement session expiration after a configurable duration.
   
2. **API Endpoints**
   - Provide CRUD endpoints for managing resources.
   - Validate and sanitize all input data.

3. **Database**
   - Ensure data consistency with ACID-compliant transactions (if using relational DB).
   - Maintain indexes for frequently queried data.

4. **Security**
   - Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Log all unauthorized access attempts for auditing.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Average response time should be under 200ms for 90% of requests.
   - System should be able to scale horizontally to meet traffic spikes.
   
2. **Reliability**
   - Ensure 99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms in place.

3. **Maintainability**
   - Write clean, well-documented, and testable code.
   - Follow consistent coding standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
